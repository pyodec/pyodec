Pyodec is a toolkit and a collection package for building and sharing codes to decode data files which are difficult or impossible to decode with other conventional automated file decoding processes. The simplest example is the decoding of human-readable ASCII text, but other files such as binary, compressed or even binary files with well-defined decoders can be decoded with pyodec.

All it requires is someone to write such a decoder.
